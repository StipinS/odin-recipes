  <p>This easy spaghetti casserole dish with ground beef is deliciously rich, hearty, and cheesy.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>12 ounces uncooked spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds ground sirloin</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped yellow onion</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 (24 ounce) jars spaghetti or marinara sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directions for Cooking</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.</li>
    <li>Boil spaghetti in generously salted water until cooked through but still firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>While pasta cooks, stir cream cheese, sour cream, and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese together until combined; set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef in large chunks and cook, undisturbed, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Continue to cook, breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and tilt the pan to pool grease onto one side, trying to keep the beef mixture on the other. Use a large spoon to remove grease; discard grease once cooled.</li>
    <li>Add marinara to beef mixture in skillet; stir until combined. Add reserved spaghetti. Fold and stir until well coated in sauce.</li>
    <li>Transfer ½ of the pasta mixture to prepared baking dish. Spread sour cream mixture evenly over pasta mixture in baking dish, then top with remaining pasta mixture.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle remaining 1 cup mozzarella evenly over spaghetti mixture. Cover loosely with aluminum foil and place baking dish on a baking sheet. </li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and sprinkle top with Parmesan cheese. Increase oven temperature to broil. </li>
    <li>Broil until cheese has started to turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
